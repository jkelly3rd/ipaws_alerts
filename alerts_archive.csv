- ACT: Leave immediately if evacuation orders are given for
your area to avoid being cut off from emergency services or
needlessly risk lives.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding
accentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to
buildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by
floating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an
extended period.
- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary
roads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems
and barriers may become stressed.
- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.
- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many
small craft broken away from moorings, especially in

- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and
rescues.
- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in
multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos,
and ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,
destructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while
increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides.
Flood control systems and barriers may become stressed.
- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple
communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or
washed away. Many places where flood waters may cover
escape routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of
moving water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions
become dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some
weakened or washed out.

* Until 1245 PM EDT Thursday.

* At 506 AM EDT, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated a
new axis of training showers has anchored across central and
western Henderson County.  Numerous additional showers producing
1-2"" per hour rainfall rates are moving into the county from the
SSW.  These showers will likely produce another 2-4"" of rainfall
over Henderson County.  This rainfall will occur on top of the
2-4"" of rainfall which impacted Henderson County last evening.  In
response to the earlier rainfall, Mud Creek has exceeded Minor
Flood Stage and the French Broad River is also out of its banks.
This additional rainfall will exacerbate ongoing flooding and
cause new areas of flooding to develop.  Significant flooding is
possible, with isolated structural impacts.

HAZARD...Life-threatening flash flooding. Thunderstorms
producing flash flooding.

SOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.

IMPACT...Life-threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams,
low-water crossings, urban areas, highways, streets,

Valley Hill, East Flat Rock, Horse Shoe, Crab Creek and Dana.
","Heavy rain is increasing the risk of landslides, especially in areas
where slides have occurred in the past. Be especially alert if you
are near a stream, especially at the base of a mountain or in a

streamflow. Leave the area quickly if this is observed. When driving
along roads where the terrain is steep or rocky, watch and listen
for falling rocks, mud, trees and other debris.

Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood
deaths occur in vehicles.

Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the
dangers of flooding.

Rainfall accumulations of 4-8 inches Wednesday night into Thursday
morning over the headwaters of the Catawba River and associated
tributaries has caused high flows and increasing lake pool
elevations along the Catawba River.  Duke Energy is passing excess
water through each reservoir upstream of Mountain Island Lake,
including immediately upstream at Cowans Ford Dam at Lake Norman.
These releases are resulting in significant rises at Mountain Island
Lake, where the pool is currently at 98.45 feet and rising rapidly.
Full pool is 100.0 feet.

Mountain Island Lake is expected to reach 103.5 feet overnight
tonight, which will result in Minor floding along the lake shoreline
as well as areas downstream of Mountain Island Dam, including within
the Riverside Dr community.  Caution is advised anywhere near the
Catawba River from Cowans Ford Dam to the Lake Wylie inlet.

Additional torrential, potentially devastating rainfall is expected
later tonight through Thursday morning from Hurricane Helene.  There
is high confidence that another 5-12 inches of rainfall will occur
from Lake Hickory to the Catawba River headwaters, with the highest
totals along the Blue Ridge Escarpment.  This rainfall will occur on
saturated soils and excessive runoff into elevated streams will
result in potentially catastrophic inflows into the Catawba River
lakes.  These flows will have to be passed downstream through the
Catawba River reservoir system, including through Mountain Island
Lake.

Based on current rainfall forecasts and conditions, Duke Energy
expects Mountain Island Lake to reach or exceed 110.0 feet later
Friday, which is 10.0 feet over full pond.  This would be a record
pool elevation at Mountain Island Lake, breaking the record of
109.60 feet which occurred in August 1940.  Mountain Island Lake
reached 106.91 feet on June 10, 2019. which is the highest crest in
the modern era.  Major Flood Stage is 105.5 feet.  These lake levels
will cause unprecedented, catastrophic flooding of Mountain Island
Lake and possibly adjacent reaches of the Catawba River.


HAZARD...Life-threatening flash flooding from dam floodgate
releases caused by excessive rainfall.

SOURCE...Duke Energy and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Emergency
Management

IMPACT...Life-threatening, Moderate flash flooding of areas
along the Catawba River from immediately downstream of

inundation of outbuildings is beginning around
Mountain Island Lake and downstream of the dam
along/near Riverside Dr.  Residents downstream of the
dam should be completing preparations to evacuate and
heeding guidance from Char-Meck Emergency Management.

* If the rainfall forecast verifies, Major flooding will be likely
along and near Mountain Island Lake and a Flash Flood Emergency
will be issued.  Residents are encouraged to heed guidance from
local officials and emergency management on any potential impacts
to property.  Drivers are encouraged to heed any barricades and
avoid all flooded areas.  This has the potential to be a historic

The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has extended
the

* Flash Flood Warning for...
A Dam Floodgate Release in...
Northeastern Gaston County in the piedmont of North Carolina...
Northwestern Mecklenburg County in the piedmont of North Carolina...

* Until 200 PM EDT Saturday.

* At 609 AM EDT, Rainfall accumulations of 4-8 inches Wednesday
night into Thursday morning over the headwaters of the Catawba
River and associated tributaries has caused high flows and
increasing lake pool elevations along the Catawba River.  Duke
Energy is passing excess water through each reservoir upstream of
Mountain Island Lake, including immediately upstream at Cowans
Ford Dam at Lake Norman.  These releases are resulting in
significant rises at Mountain Island Lake, where the pool is
currently at 103.3 feet.  Full pool is 100.0 feet.

* Mountain Island Lake pool rises are slowing but this only
temporary. Additional torrential and devastating rainfall is
developing and will persist through early this afternoon as
rainfall from Tropical Storm Helene moves across the Catawba River
Valley.  There is high confidence that another 3-6 inches of
rainfall will occur from Lake Hickory to the Catawba River
headwaters, with the highest totals along the Blue Ridge
Escarpment.  This rainfall is occurring on saturated soils and
excessive runoff into elevated streams will likely result in
catastrophic inflows into the Catawba River lakes.  These flows
will have to be passed downstream through the Catawba River
reservoir system, including through Mountain Island Lake.

* Based on current rainfall forecasts and conditions, Duke Energy
expects Mountain Island Lake to reach or exceed 110.0 feet later
today, which is 10.0 feet over full pond.  This would be a record
pool elevation at Mountain Island Lake, breaking the record of
109.60 feet which occurred in August 1940.  Mountain Island Lake
reached 106.91 feet on June 10, 2019. which is the highest crest in
the modern era.  Major Flood Stage is 105.5 feet.  These lake levels
will cause unprecedented, catastrophic flooding of Mountain Island
Lake and possibly adjacent reaches of the Catawba River.

* Until 645 PM EDT Friday.

* At 652 AM EDT, Lake James is beginning to respond to torrential
rainfall and potentially catastrophic inflows entering the
headwaters of the Catawba River associated with Tropical Storm
Helene.  Additional rainfall of 4-7 inches is likely through later
this morning, on top of rainfall accumulations of 4-8 inches
Wednesday night into Thursday morning.  Lake James is rising
rapidly in response to this rainfall where the current pool is
104.13 feet.  Additional rises are expected over the next several
hours, with Lake James likely to exceed the Moderate Flood Stage
of 105.0 feet.  More significant shoreline flooding, capable of
inundating homes and other structures, is developing.

* Based on current rainfall forecasts and conditions, Duke Energy
expects Lake James to reach or exceed 110.0 feet later today,
which is 10.0 feet over full pond.  The current record pool
elevation at Lake James is 107.36 feet which occurred in September
8, 2004 during Hurricane Frances.  Major Flood Stage is 110.0
feet.  These lake levels will cause unprecedented, catastrophic
flooding of Lake James and adjacent reaches of the Catawba River.

* If the rainfall forecast verifies, Moderate to Major flooding will
be likely along and near Lake James and a Flash Flood Emergency
may be issued very soon.  Residents are encouraged to heed
guidance from local officials and emergency management on any
potential impacts to property.  Drivers are encouraged to heed any
barricades and avoid all flooded areas.  This has the potential to
be a historic and extremely dangerous event.  Please stay weather
aware and monitor lake levels and Duke Energy projections closely
for any changes.

since Wednesday evening from Lake Hickory to the Catawba River
headwaters, with the highest totals exceeding 2 feet along the
Blue Ridge Escarpment across the upper Catawba River watershed.
This is resulting in catastrophic and historic inflows into
Catawba River reservoirs and this water is being moved through the
system to Lookout Shoals Lake and points downstream.

The latest pool elevations for the upper Catawba River lakes are as
follows (Full Pool is 100.0 feet):

Lake James: 102.00 feet and steady.
Lake Rhodhiss: 104.62 feet and rising rapidly.
Lake Hickory: 99.70 feet and rising rapidly.
Lookout Shoals Lake: 103.48 feet and rising steadily.

* Based on current rainfall forecasts and conditions, Duke Energy
expects Lookout Shoals Lake to reach or exceed 110.0 feet later
Friday, which is 10.0 feet over full pond.  The current record
pool elevation at Lookout Shoals Lake is 114.40 feet which
occurred in August 1940.  Lookout Shoals Lake reached 108.30 feet
on November 12, 2020, which is the highest crest in the modern
era.  Major Flood Stage is 106.0 feet.  These lake levels will
cause unprecedented, catastrophic flooding of Lookout Shoals Lake
and possibly adjacent reaches of the Catawba River.


HAZARD...Life threatening flash flooding. Heavy rain producing
flash flooding.

since Wednesday evening from Lake Hickory to the Catawba River
headwaters, with the highest totals exceeding 2 feet along the
Blue Ridge Escarpment across the upper Catawba River watershed.
This is resulting in catastrophic and historic inflows into
Catawba River reservoirs and this water is being moved through the
system from Lake James to Lake Rhodhiss and points downstream.

* The latest pool elevations for the upper Catawba River lakes are
as follows (Full Pool is 100.0 feet):

Lake James: 102.00 feet and steady.
Lake Rhodhiss: 105.39 feet and rising steadily.
Lake Hickory: 99.24 feet and rising steadily.
Lookout Shoals Lake: 104.15 feet and rising steadily.

* Based on current rainfall forecasts and conditions, Duke Energy
expects Lake Rhodhiss to reach or exceed 110.0 feet later today,
which is 10.0 feet over full pond.  The current record pool
elevation at Lake Rhodhiss is 110.10 feet which occurred in August
1940.  Major Flood Stage is 110.0 feet.  These lake levels may
cause unprecedented, catastrophic flooding of Lake Rhodhiss and
possibly adjacent reaches of the Catawba River.

IMPACT...Moderate to Major flooding of the Lake Rhodhiss
shoreline and areas along the Catawba River both up
and downstream of the lake is imminent.  At 104.0
feet...Floodwaters may approach homes and businesses
between Morganton and Lake Rhodhiss.  Backwater
effects will impact several tributaries including
Silver Creek and Lower Creek, causing flooding of low-
lying areas along the tributaries, including at
Antioch Rd.  River access points will be flooded,
including at Huffman Bridge Rd. The Catawba River
Greenway near Morganton is likely flooded as well.  At
higher stages, some homes at the lower reach of the
lake may be impacted by flood waters and evacuations
may be required.  Significant shoreline flooding is
occurring.
